## About the Game:

This game is a simple computer game using JavaScript. In this game the computer randomaly chooses a letter, which is unknown to the game player, and the player has **9** attempts to correctly guess the letter the computer chose.

## How to play:

* Go to this link --> [Pyschic-Game :crystal_ball:](https://melissajwomack.github.io/Psychic-Game/)
* Simply press any letter key to guess a letter.
* If a player choses the same letter twice, an alert will show telling the player the letter was already chosen, and the player will still have the same number of guess remaining.
* If a player presses a key that is not a letter key, an alert will show and tell the player they did not press a letter key. Pressing a key other than a letter will not reduce the amount of remaining guesses.
